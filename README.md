# Indoor Routing Xamarin

This repo provides an example app called [Indoor Routing for iOS](https://developers.arcgis.com/example-apps/indoor-routing-xamarin/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=example_apps_indoor_xamarin_ios) devices built in Xamarin with the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/).  With some customization, you can change the app to use your indoor data and locators. Screenshots of the app and more detailed documentation can be found on the [Developers Site](https://developers.arcgis.com/example-apps/indoor-routing-xamarin/)

## Development Instructions
This Indoor Routing repo is a Xamarin Studio Project that can be directly cloned and imported into Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio.

### Fork the repo
**Fork** the [Indoor Routing Xamarin](https://github.com/Esri/indoor-routing-xamarin/fork) repo.

### Clone the repo
Once you have forked the repo, you can make a clone.

#### Command line Git
1. [Clone the Indoor Routing repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo#step-2-clone-your-fork)
2. ```cd``` into the ```indoor-routing-xamarin``` folder
3. Make your changes and create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)

### Configuring a Remote for a Fork
If you make changes in the fork and would like to [sync](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) those changes with the upstream repository, you must first [configure the remote](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/). This will be required when you have created local branches and would like to make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) to your upstream branch.

1. In the Terminal (for Mac users) or command prompt (fow Windows and Linux users) type ```git remote -v``` to list the current configured remote repo for your fork.
2. ```git remote add upstream https://github.com/Esri/indoor-routing-xamarin.git``` to specify new remote upstream repository that will be synced with the fork. You can type ```git remote -v``` to verify the new upstream.

If there are changes made in the Original repository, you can sync the fork to keep it updated with upstream repository.

1. In the terminal, change the current working directory to your local project.
2. Type ```git fetch upstream``` to fetch the commits from the upstream repository.
3. ```git checkout master``` to checkout your fork's local master branch.
4. ```git merge upstream/master``` to sync your local `master` branch with `upstream/master`. **Note**: Your local changes will be retained and your fork's master branch will be in sync with the upstream repository.

## Requirements
* [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET 100.9 or higher](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/)
* [XCode 12 or higher](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) and the iOS 13 SDK.
* [Visual Studio for Mac - latest](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/) or [Visual Studio 2017 or higher](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/whatsnew/)
